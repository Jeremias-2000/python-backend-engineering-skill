# python-backend-engineering

A Kiro agent skill that enforces clean architecture, domain-driven design principles, and AWS Lambda best practices for Python backends.

## What it does

Activates when you're designing, scaffolding, implementing, reviewing, or refactoring any Python backend — APIs, workers, AWS Lambdas, or event-driven services. It guides the agent through:

- **Architecture decisions** — proportional complexity, module boundaries, dependency direction
- **Domain modeling** — entities, aggregates, value objects, domain services, domain events
- **Application layer** — use cases, commands/queries, ports, transaction boundaries, event publishing
- **Infrastructure** — FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, boto3, Pydantic v2, async vs sync, Lambda patterns
- **Logging & observability** — JSON logging for Lambda/CloudWatch, LoggerAdapter, structured context
- **Testing & quality** — domain unit tests, application fakes/stubs, event contract tests, architecture review checklist

## When to use it

The agent activates this skill automatically when it detects tasks related to:

- Python backend architecture or refactoring
- AWS Lambda handler design
- DDD patterns (entities, aggregates, value objects, repositories, ports)
- SQS/SNS/EventBridge consumer design
- Configuration management, logging, or observability in Python services

Reference docs are loaded on demand — the agent only pulls in the relevant section based on the task at hand, keeping context lean.

## Key principles enforced

- Architecture must be proportional to complexity — CRUD does not justify DDD
- Framework types (FastAPI, boto3, ORM) must never leak into domain or application code
- Configuration is loaded at the infrastructure boundary, never discovered inside business logic
- Message consumers must be designed for idempotency (at-least-once delivery)
- Every new abstraction must have a stated problem, owner, and testability benefit
- JSON structured logging for Lambda/CloudWatch; plaintext for local development

## Security notes

The `references/` directory contains Markdown documentation only — no executable scripts. This skill is safe to install and does not run any shell commands.
